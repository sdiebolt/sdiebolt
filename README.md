### Hi, I'm Samuel 👋

- 🧠 I am a Research Fellow in the [lab of Prof. Matteo Carandini and Prof. Kenneth Harris](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cortexlab) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). I use [functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_ultrasound_imaging) to study brain activity in awake mice.

- 🔧 I am passionate about developing tools and software to improve the usability of fUSI in neuroscience, including:
  - Extending the [Brain Imaging Data Structure](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) (BIDS) to support fUSI data ([BEP proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W3z01mf1E8cfg_OY7ZGqeUeOKv659jCHQBXavtmT-T8/edit?usp=sharing)).
  - Soon-to-be-released tools for handling, visualization, and analysis of fUSI data.
  
- 🎓 I completed my PhD in medical imaging, where I investigated fingerprints of [functional connectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_functional_connectivity) in pharmacological studies using functional ultrasound imaging at [Iconeus](https://iconeus.com).
  
- 🧑🏻‍🎓 I hold two master's degrees from [PSL Research University](https://psl.eu/en): 
  - Master of Science in Biotechnology from [ESPCI Paris](https://www.espci.psl.eu/en/)
  - Master's Degree in Science and Executive Engineering from [MINES Paris](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu)

- ✨ I believe in releasing every piece of software I develop into the wild. You can see some of it in my repositories, and hopefully the rest will become open source soon!
