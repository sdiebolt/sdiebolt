### Hi, I'm Samuel 👋

- 🧠 I am a Research Engineer at [Iconeus](https://iconeus.com), currently pursuing a PhD in medical imaging. I am using [functional ultrasound imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_ultrasound_imaging) to look for fingerprints of [functional connectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_functional_connectivity) in pharmacological studies.

- 🧑🏻‍🎓 I have recently completed two master's degrees: 
  - a Master of Science in Biotechnology from [ESPCI Paris](https://www.espci.psl.eu/en/);
  - a Master's Degree in Science and Executive Engineering from [MINES Paris](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu). 
  
  ESPCI Paris and MINES Paris are two french engineering schools from [PSL Research University](https://psl.eu/en). 

- ✨ When legally possible, I believe in releasing every piece of software I develop into the wild. You can see some of it in my repositories, and hopefully the rest will become open source soon!
