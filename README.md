### Hi, I'm Samuel 👋

- 🧠 I'm a Bioinformatics Intern at the [Institute of Psychiatry and Neuroscience of Paris](https://ipnp.paris5.inserm.fr/english-language), working on [functional ultrasound imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_ultrasound_imaging) analysis. My PhD on this subject should start later this year!

- 👨🏻‍💻 I've recently completed a Master of Science in Biotechnology from [ESPCI Paris](https://www.espci.psl.eu/en/). I'm also finishing a Master's Degree in Science and Executive Engineering from [Mines ParisTech](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu). ESPCI Paris and Mines ParisTech are two french engineering schools from [PSL Research University](https://psl.eu/en). 

- ✨ When legally possible, I believe in releasing every piece of software I develop into the wild. You can see some of it in my repositories, and hopefully the rest will become open source soon!
