### Hi, I'm Samuel ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ§  I am a Research Fellow in the [lab of Prof. Matteo Carandini and Prof. Kenneth Harris](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cortexlab) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). I use [functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_ultrasound_imaging) to study brain activity in awake mice.

- ðŸ”§ I am passionate about developing tools and software to improve the usability of fUSI in neuroscience, including:
  - Extending the [Brain Imaging Data Structure](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) (BIDS) to support fUSI data ([BEP proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W3z01mf1E8cfg_OY7ZGqeUeOKv659jCHQBXavtmT-T8/edit?usp=sharing)).
  - Soon-to-be-released tools for handling, visualization, and analysis of fUSI data.

- âœ¨ I believe in releasing every piece of software I develop into the wild. You can see some of it in my repositories, and hopefully the rest will become open source soon!
